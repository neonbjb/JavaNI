This is a bridging project that allows Java to access the depth map generated by a Kinect Sensor
and exported to the OpenNI SDK. It uses a rudimentary local socket interface to connect the
host C++ application to the Java application that wants to use the data.

The host application can be found in the cpp_iface_prj folder. It is a simple Visual Studio
application written just to do dumb forwarding.

The processor of data received from the host application can be found in the generators/TraceClient
class.

The project also contains some logic for deriving shapes from depth map information. Specifically it
contains the capability to search for hands and fingers and track their perceived center against the
background. This logic is encapsulated in the processors/ package.

Finally, there are some sample UI's that use swing to display the depth map and the processing done
on it. These can be found in the root package.

This application is meant to be compiled and run on Netbeans.
